one-pager website called "TravelBuddy" that helps travelers find unique travel companions based on their interests and travel plans. This website will collect user information, travel interests, and trip details, storing them in a database to match users with potential travel buddies. The site will have a simple, clean design, featuring a registration form and a section displaying the user's matches.
